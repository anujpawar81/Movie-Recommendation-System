# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project presents a recommender system using the TMDB dataset and sentiment analysis. 
Within the recommendation engine, sophisticated machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes are employed to analyze user preferences and sentiments extracted from textual reviews. 
The Movie Recommendation System utilizing sentiment analysis with machine
learning employs a multifaceted technological approach to deliver personalized
recommendations to users. At the front end, technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
are utilized to create an intuitive user interface, while AJAX modules facilitate dynamic and
live updates to the system. Within the recommendation engine, sophisticated machine learning
algorithms including Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and TF-IDF Vectorizer are
employed to analyze user preferences and sentiments extracted from textual reviews. These
algorithms enable the system to understand the context and sentiment behind user interactions,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of recommendations. On the backend, Python serves as the
primary programming language, facilitating the implementation of the recommendation engine
and interaction with external APIs. Additionally, tools such as Jupyter Notebook and Visual
Studio Code are leveraged for development, testing, and optimization of the recommendation
system. Together, these technologies form a cohesive framework that empowers the Movie
Recommendation System to deliver personalized and engaging content recommendations to
users.
